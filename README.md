Virtual Health Assitance
The workflow of our AI-powered health assistant is designed to simplify healthcare interactions. Users begin by entering their health inquiries or requests for appointments through a user-friendly chat interface. The AI assistant, powered by a sophisticated language model, analyzes the user's input and provides relevant information or guides them through the appointment scheduling process. For appointment scheduling, the assistant gathers necessary details such as patient name, specialty, preferred date, and time. Once the information is collected, the assistant confirms the appointment details and provides a summary of the scheduled visit. This streamlined workflow eliminates the need for phone calls and manual form filling, making healthcare management more efficient and accessible for users
